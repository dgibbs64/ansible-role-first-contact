This role does the following on first contact.

- Check if the ansible user exists.
- If not connect to the host as root.
  - create the ansible user (deploy_user).
  - add the ansible user to the sudoers group.
  - add the control node public key to the host ansible user.
  - set the ansible user's shell.
  - bootstrap the host using [robertdebock.bootstrap](https://galaxy.ansible.com/robertdebock/bootstrap).
  - install ansible dependencies using [robertdebock.core_dependencies](https://galaxy.ansible.com/robertdebock/core_dependencies).

> The ansible user (deploy_user) is the user that runs ansible commands on the host.

## Example Usage

When creating a VPS using popular providers such as [Linode](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/cloud-manager/guides/manage-ssh-keys/), [Digital Ocean](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/), [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/security-ssh-access.html), etc. you can normaly specify a public key to be added to the root user during installation. You can use this role to login using the root user to then create the ansible user.

## Requirements

robertdebock.bootstrap

## Role Variables

```yaml
---
bypass_host_identity_check: false
bypass_host_key_check: true
connection_timeout: 3
deploy_user: "deploy"
ssh_key_location: "~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"
```

`deploy_user` is the user that ansible will use to log in to the host. Leave unset to use the user that is running ansible.

> The below variables are SSH security related. It is important the implications of each are understood.

From the SSH man page:
_ssh automatically maintains and checks a database containing identification for all hosts it has ever been used with. Host keys are stored in ~/.ssh/known_hosts in the user's home directory. Additionally, the file /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts is automatically checked for known hosts. Any new hosts are automatically added to the user's file. If a host's identification ever changes, ssh warns about this and disables password authentication to prevent server spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks, which could other‚Äêwise be used to circumvent the encryption. The StrictHostKeyChecking option can be used to control logins to machines whose host key is not known or has changed._

If `bypass_host_key_check` is _true_ SSH [host key checking](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/connection_details.html#managing-host-key-checking) will be bypassed for first contact only. Subsequent checks will be carried out as per `host_key_checking` [setting](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/connection_details.html#managing-host-key-checking). This removes the requirement to manualy type yes to the below message.

```bash
The authenticity of host '192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:1RG/OFcYAVv57kcP784oaoeHcwjvHDAgtTFBckveoHE.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

If `bypass_host_identity_check` is _true_ the below message will automatically be resolved. This is useful if your VPS is being rebuilt regularly. However you will no longer be protected by this ssh feature when running this role.

```bash
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
51:82:00:1c:7e:6f:ac:ac:de:f1:53:08:1c:7d:55:68.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /home/user/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending RSA key in /home/user/.ssh/known_hosts:12
RSA host key for 192.168.1.1 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
```
